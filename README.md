## Kata Ranking (kyu)
*source: [Codewars Wiki Honor & Ranks](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Honor-&-Ranks) and [Codewars Wiki Kata Ranking](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Ranking)*

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

<!--
### **1 kyu** kata represent a proficient programming level.

At this level kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging. They may include concepts such as:
* Advanced AI/machine learning algorithms
* Complex interpreters and compilers
* Complex Mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a complete markdown parser)
-->
<!--
### **2 kyu** kata represent a proficient programming level.

At this level kata require a mature understanding of complex programming concepts - concepts such as:
* Complex AI/machine learning algorithms
* Reverse engineering techniques
* Basic interpreters and compilers
* Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic markdown parser)
-->
<!--
### **3 kyu** kata represent a competent programming level.

At this level the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging. They include tasks that may handle:
* Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms
* Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion
* Basic AI/machine learning algorithms
* Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography
-->
### **4 kyu** kata represent a competent programming level.

At this level the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete. They include tasks that may handle:
* Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
* Advanced design patterns
* Understanding intricate business requirements
* Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

### **5 kyu** kata represent a novice programming level.

At this level the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging. It includes:
* Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts
* Advanced OOP/Functional concepts
* Complex Design Patterns
* Advanced regular expression usage

### **6 kyu** kata represent a novice programming level.

At this level the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:
* Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
* Complex OOP/Functional concepts
* Basic Design Patterns
* Complex Regular Expressions

### **7 kyu** kata represent a beginner programming level.

At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge. Tasks such as:
* Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
* Basic data type manipulations
* Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
* Basic Regular Expressions

### **8 kyu** kata represent a beginner level.

At this level the kata is only challenging for users new to programming. This includes programming tasks such as:
* Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
* Basic variable assignments
* Fixing basic syntax issues
* Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements
